This **Movie Recommendation App** is a web application that utilizes the Sentence Transformers library to generate embeddings and recommend movies based on their similarity. 
Frontend is built with `React` and for backend with `FastAPI` and uses Sentence Transformers for text embedding and a recommendation model to suggest relevant movies from the TMDB dataset.

Use the `README.md` to get started.
